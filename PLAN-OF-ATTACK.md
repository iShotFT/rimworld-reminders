# RimWorld Advanced Reminder System - Plan of Attack

## Current Status: Phase 1 MVP Complete + Enhanced UI! üéâ‚ú®üé®
We have successfully completed the foundational MVP with working reminder creation, time-based triggers, notification system, hotkey integration, functional UI dialog, AND a completely overhauled main tab window for managing reminders. Critical save/load bugs have been resolved, the UI has been dramatically improved with rich information display, and the mod is now fully functional for basic reminder management.

## üéØ Overall Strategy

### Build Philosophy
- **Incremental Development**: Each phase delivers working functionality
- **RimWorld-First**: Follow game patterns and conventions religiously
- **Test Early, Test Often**: Validate each component as we build it
- **Performance-Conscious**: Design for 100+ reminders from day one
- **Localization-Ready**: Build with multi-language support from the start

### Risk Mitigation
- **Save Game Safety**: Never corrupt user saves, handle versioning carefully
- **Performance Impact**: Profile early and often, especially with tick processing
- **User Experience**: Every UI element must feel native to RimWorld
